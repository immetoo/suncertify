** fully NIO based:

The database server and the network layer are both based
on an implemention on the java nio libary.

I've choices NIO because I had no real experiance with it 
so it was a nice opertunty to learn it.

Working with it is real harder then it seems at first hand.
To get all details right is even working around jvm bugs.


** Proxy classes

I see proxy classes heavly used in modren (ee) server based 
applictions, mostly even without the programmer noticing it.

It provides a nice layer to dynamicly plugin the networking layer
between the database and the client.


** Bean bases server

Made a simple implemention of how EE containers manages the backend
beans and depecicies.
